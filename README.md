# BUProjects

Welcome,

This is a post-hoc repository and portfolio of projects and assignments accumulated over the many years of study during my MS in Computer Science at Boston University's Metropolitan College.  The work captured here is the output of my academic efforts while learning new coding languages, systems, methods and tools over a long time of study.  As such, there may be errors, things may not work, code libraries could have been updated or deprecated and things may simply not work.

This repository is not under particularly active development, but if you have questions feel free to ask and I will do my best to provide answers.


Thanks for stopping by,

Jefferson Parker
